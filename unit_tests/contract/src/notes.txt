I am unsure of the viewing policy of smart contracts
Can I try accessing some on the NEAR blockchain first?
Look at how much of it gets exposed in the blockchain
I mean 4.19 mB is not a lot
so you can could do a mix of decentralization or partial when avaliable

So the data has to be immutable meaning 
to has to be initialized at start

checks how the data sample is created
if it is a string 

Who recieves this data?
Like in what method?
if sends to email than we can't control how its used
env::predecss

contract keeps a list of contacts
for those who have access to it
you can ask the contract for the data

meaning we shard the data across multiple contracts

Else we have a 
centralized database at the end
Or the user sends the data to he user
through the server
So we only hold that data

so when you login in to d-mart with your near wallet
it will automatically provide the contracts which are avaliable
and it will tell you its pending
if nothing pulled from the marketplace and contract
determined as a faulty contract

Storage costs come in two forms
The client sends data to the smart contract
And the holding fee for the smart contract's data
You have to provide a limit send restriction for accounts
And a max in the system per day

// You have to validate addresses
// env::is_valid_account_id

There must be a way to to ensure that dataset is immutable
I think you would need a special blockchain for that
Is this why ocean coin is soo good

Maybe consider an update log?? How so?
